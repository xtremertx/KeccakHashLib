# KeccakHashLib
Features a Keccak hashing support for .NET

Testing vectors:
- I have tested all the avaible Keccak bit sizes with some vectors (zero input, 'TEXT', ..) and their respective output against accesible web implementation of keccak, all the vectors succesfully passed.

Final statement: 

I DO NOT TAKE ANY CREDITS OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CODE (ONLY CREDIT FOR DOING SO ^^).
I JUST EXTRACTED THIS CODE TO GAIN ONLY KECCAK SUPPORT FROM LARGER LIBRARY, PLEASE SUPPORT ORIGINAL AUTHOR!
